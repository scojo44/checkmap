Capstone 2 - Project Ideas
==========================

I think it would be fun to create an app that uses a map.  I will likely use the MapBox API for map tiles and the Leaflet library for the UI.  MapBox looks like they have a nice free tier for most of their APIs.

Visited US Counties Tracker
---------------------------

This would be a map showing which counties or county equivalents one has been in.  A lot of people have fun keeping track of states visited but avid road trippers may take this to the next level and “collect” counties.  Ideally, users would just have to click a county on a map and it would change color.  OpenDataSoft has an API to provide county info and boundaries.  Users would be able to create multiple lists of counties.

Airplane Flight Map
-------------------

Ever see a plane flying in the sky and wonder where it’s going?  Believe it not, there are apps that will show you info on planes flying near you.  My version would be a simple map showing planes in the sky.  Clicking a plane will show the departure and arrival airports, what model plane it is, etc.  Possible user features are adding flights to a watchlist or getting notified when a plane is within so many miles of a point.  Free APIs for this are quite limited.  One I found allows 500 requests per month.

Package Tracker
---------------

This would be a simple package tracker.  There are apps that do this and support hundreds of shipping companies worldwide but mine would just use UPS, FedEx and the postal service in the USA.  With a tracking code, one can get an estimated delivery date, see where the package has been, etc.  The locations along its journey can be displayed on a map.  Users can save tracking numbers and get notified when there’s an update.
